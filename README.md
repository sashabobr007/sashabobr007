# Hello there! üëã

I'm a 3rd year student at MPEI University with a degree in software engineering and passionate Junior iOS developer with a love for learning and problem solving. More than a year on personal Swift projects. I try to write clean and easy-to-read code, learn new things in order to improve myself, apt to accept new challenges.
